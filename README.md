# Quick explanation
🔥Based on Adrenaline, meaning it'll be snappy and fast while still having quality client-side mods for nerds.

😊Completely client-side, meaning this can be used on any server! Make sure some of the mods are allowed though. (Such as Tweakeroo.)

🤞I'll try to keep it as updated as possible! I will be mostly using mods only from Modrinth, but other mods might have to be used from Curseforge.

⚙️Pre-configured, while still allowing easy modification for your own tastes. I encourage you to set your keybinds!

🤓Has nerdy, but useful mods such as EssentialGUI and Tweakeroo. These mods can show you more data or give functionality client-side.

# 🔥Optimization Mods
Based on Adrenaline. Please refer to it to see what it has!
(Has the 'essential' optimization mods, such as Sodium.)

# 🤓Nerdy Mods, which provide useful data and information while still having useful things for non-nerds.

# Misc information

This is my first ever modpack! I'm not very experienced, and this would be a "personal use" type of thing. But I just wanted to see what I am capable of!

This modpack is based on  _Adrenaline_, credit isn't required but I still feel like I should give it! It is also inspired by _Hydrogen_, a modpack which I really enjoy using!

(No it isn't called stealers pack just bc i 'stole' adrenaline)
