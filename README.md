# Might be different from the modrinth one. As of 17/08/2023, it's newer. Might be outdated soon.

# A not-so-simple modpack for Minecraft nerds.

![A picture of a Minecraft title saying Stealers Pack.](https://github.com/MrWomanStealer/Stealer-s-Pack/blob/main/minecraft_title.png?raw=true)

[Based on Adrenaline](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaline), while adding quality of life mods. Such as [Tweakeroo](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tweakeroo) and [Bedrock Miner](https://modrinth.com/mod/next-fabric-bedrock-miner)


# Update Frequency

I try updating the modpack as soon as updates get delivered, but at times some incompabilities happen which requires me to delay updates. (Such as Sodium updating, but Indium hasn't been updated.)


# Simple Voice Chat and e4mc
The modpack has two mods that makes playing with your friends easier.

[Simple Voice Chat](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat) is a mod that, well, simply allows you to chat in-game with friends. If the server has it and other players have it, and you too, you can simply chat with your friends in proximity.
Don't have a server? Try [e4mc](https://modrinth.com/mod/e4mc).  e4mc allows you to host a game yourself, with no GUIs or fancy stuff. You host LAN, click on a chat message that pops up and you get a copyable link.
(Essential was removed for a few reasons. You are free to add it back if you like.)


# Completely Client Sided
The modpack is completely client-side, meaning you can connect to your friends server, any big server or basically any server that isn't modded itself.
If you really want to use this modpack on servers with mods, just add them into this modpack!


# What else?

That's pretty much it. There are some pictures in the gallery section about the mod, showing the HUD and any GUIs that I think are important. This modpack is centered around the thought that you can modify it to your tastes. Remove mods, add mods, change GUIs and keybinds. Do what you want! Hell, you can base your own modpack off of this too! Credit isn't required. You are free to give credit tho :)



# Notes

The modpack has four (five) mods that are from CurseForge. The reason for this is that these mods fit this modpack perfectly, but they aren't on modrinth. Installing the modpack may prompt you to download these modpacks from external sources. These mods include:

[Tweakeroo](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tweakeroo)

[Litematica](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/litematica)

[MiniHud](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/minihud)

[Inventory HUD+](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/inventory-hud-forge)

And also [MaLiLib, but that's just so you can use MiniHud, Litematica or Tweakeroo.](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/malilib)
[Here's a tutorial for litematica.](https://youtu.be/aMZSXAKZzpo?t=134) Feel free to skip a bit into the future, I just skipped it to after installation.
