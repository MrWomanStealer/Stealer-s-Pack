# Quick explanation (The mini-modlist below only indicates the 'big' ones that you will use, while not having all of the mods here.)
🔥Based on [Adrenaline](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaline), meaning it'll be snappy and fast while still having quality client-side mods for nerds.

😊Completely client-side, meaning this can be used on any server! Make sure some of the mods are allowed though. (Such as Tweakeroo.)

🤞I'll try to keep it as updated as possible! I will be mostly using mods only from Modrinth, but other mods might have to be used from Curseforge.

⚙️Pre-configured, while still allowing easy modification for your own tastes. I encourage you to set your keybinds!

🤓Has nerdy, but useful mods such as EssentialGUI and Tweakeroo. These mods can show you more data or give functionality client-side.

# 🔥Optimization Mods
Based on Adrenaline. Please refer to it to see what it has!

(Has the 'essential' optimization mods, such as Sodium.)

# 🤓Nerdy Mods, which provide useful data and information while still having functionality.
E.g Tweakeroo and Tweakermore for your shenanigans.

E.g EssentialGUI, BetterF3 and MiniHud, which give useful data.

# ⚙️Quality Of Life Mods
E.g Essential and Borderless mining. While not nerdy or for optimizations, these can make your Minecraft life better.

E.g Plasmo voice, allowing you to chat with your friends who also have it, or if the server has it.

# Misc information

This is my first ever modpack! I'm not very experienced, and this would be a "personal use" type of thing. But I just wanted to see what I am capable of!

This modpack is based on  _Adrenaline_, credit isn't required but I still feel like I should give it! It is also inspired by _Hydrogen_, a modpack which I really enjoy using!

(No it isn't called stealers pack just bc i 'stole' adrenaline)
