# Stealer's Pack
A simple modpack based on Adrenaline that has nerdy mods, such as Tweakeroo and EssentialGUI. Based of Adrenaline.

# Quick explanation
🔥Designed to be snappy and fast, while having quality of life features for nerds.

😊Completely client-side, meaning this can be used on any server! Make sure some of the mods are allowed though. (Such as Tweakeroo)

🤞I'll try to keep it as updated as possible! I will be mostly using mods only from Modrinth, but other mods might have to be used from Curseforge.

⚙️Pre-configured, while still allowing easy modification for your own tastes.

🤓Has nerdy, but useful mods such as EssentialGUI and Tweakeroo.

# Misc information

This is my first ever modpack! I'm not very experienced, and this would be a "personal use" type of thing. But I just wanted to see what I am capable of!

This modpack is based off of _Adrenaline_, credit isn't required but I still feel like I should give it! It is also inspired by _Hydrogen_, a modpack which I really enjoy using!

(No it isn't called stealers pack just bc i 'stole' adrenaline)
